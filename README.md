# DMACC-FinalProject

Formalized Proposal 
It is important to eat out as a family; however, many times a large family may have to wait for a smaller table for a smalle rfamily to clear up first – and that smaller family takes priority. When families walk into a restaurant, a family may contain five members, and another family may retain two family members. An application that keeps track of the family size and when they should be seated is the solution.
The restaurant family member size tracker will use a Priority Queue of available tables with the priority being size. Families will sign in, creating a family object which include the number of members in that family. Those families will then be places in a queue. I will perform an insertion sort to sort the families based on size (largest to smallest). There will be a randomized table size that opens up – and the largest family that fits in the table will be remove

Lessons Learned 
In terms of the scope of the project, not much changed. I did have to take a bit of a different approach when it came to the implementation of the project - but most of it was expected. As a result of this, I did not run into many blockers.
The largest blocker that I encountered came when implementing the GUI. Unfortunately, upon my initial attempt to put together the GUI, it did not look how I was expecting. Because of this, I was forced to refactor essentially the entirety of the GUI, which led me breaking the code, which led me to refactoring the code.

Conclusion/Summary 

	There are six key principles to MERUSE. The first is Modularity. Modularity addresses writing code so that they are reusable. I did this by creating functions that could easily be applied to other programs. The second key principle is Efficiency. I was able to accomplish efficiency by using one of the most efficient sorting algorithms - insertion sort. The next key principle is Robustness. Robustness means that the program should not break - which I accomplished with extensive testing. If there is an input entered that should not have been entered, the program either throws an error (that I created) or does not accept that user input. The next principle is Usability. This means that it is easy to use for the user. I accomplished this with appropriate formatting of the GUI, making it very straightforward. The fifth key principal is Should Be Readable. This refers to the code being easy to read - which I accomplished by naturally writing code. As I have learned to code, I have naturally learned to write clean code, not just functional code, and this is something that I apply to every program that I write. The last key principle is Elegant. This principle addresses the idea of beautiful code - which stems off what I just noted. This principle could be seen from multiple standpoints, as I may think beautiful code looks different than others. 
It is important to eat out as a family; however, many times a large family may have to sit for a smaller table for a smaller family to clear up first - and that smaller family takes priority. When families walk into a restaurant, a family may contain 5 family members, and another family may retain two family members. An application that keeps track of the family size and when they should be seated is the solution. Families sign in and are placed in a queue. I sort the families based on size (largest to smallest). There is a randomized table size that opens up - and the largest family that fits in that table is be printed out!
In the future, I would like to make this application responsive, and add a few more features. Other than that, I am happy with how this program has turned out!
