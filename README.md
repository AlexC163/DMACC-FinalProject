# DMACC-FinalProject

It is important to eat out as a family; however, many times a large family may have to wait for a smaller table for a smalle rfamily to clear up first – and that smaller family takes priority. When families walk into a restaurant, a family may contain five members, and another family may retain two family members. An application that keeps track of the family size and when they should be seated is the solution.

The restaurant family member size tracker will use a Priority Queue of available tables with the priority being size. Families will sign in, creating a family object which include the number of members in that family. Those families will then be places in a queue. I will perform an insertion sort to sort the families based on size (largest to smallest). There will be a randomized table size that opens up – and the largest family that fits in the table will be remove
